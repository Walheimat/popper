;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minor-mode to designate buffers as "popups" and
;; summon and dismiss them with a key. Useful for many things, including
;; toggling REPLS, documentation, compilation or shell output, etc. This package
;; will place buffers on your screen, but it works best in conjunction with some
;; system to handle window creation and placement, like shackle.el. Under the
;; hood popper summons windows defined by the user as "popups" by simply
;; calling `display-buffer'.
;;
;; COMMANDS:
;;
;; popper-toggle-latest : Toggle latest popup
;; popper-cycle         : Cycle through all popups, or close all open popups
;; popper-toggle-type   : Turn a regular window into a popup or vice-versa
;;
;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;;
;; `popper-reference-buffers': A list of major modes or regexps whose
;; corresponding buffer major-modes or regexps (respectively) should be treated
;; as popups.
;;
;; `popper-mode-line': String or sexp to show in the mode-line of
;; popper. Setting this to NIL removes the mode-line entirely from
;; popper.
;;
;; TODO: Add popup list maintenance to `make-frame-finish-functions',
;; (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'popper-update-popups)
